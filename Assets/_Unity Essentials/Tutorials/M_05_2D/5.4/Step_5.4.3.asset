        m_Untranslated: "Designing a fun level is more difficult than people think.
          In game design studios, there are full-time level designers who are responsible
          for crafting the gameplay space and flow, embedding interactive elements
          and game mechanics, and refining levels through playtesting to optimize
          the player's experience. \n\nCan you make this simple 2D level more fun
          and challenging to play? \n\nYou might consider drawing inspiration from
          classic Sokoban puzzle designs. <b>Sokoban</b> is a type of strategy game
          where the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, aiming to
          get them to designated storage locations. The challenge lies in the fact
          that boxes can only be pushed, not pulled, and the player needs to navigate
          through tight spaces without getting the boxes stuck against walls or in
          corners. \n\nThis optional challenge is classified as Expert difficulty."

          inspiration on arranging collectibles in a way that introduces puzzle-solving
          elements to your level design. \n\n<b>2.</b>  Duplicate your existing scene
          to experiment with level design by selecting the scene and pressing <b>Ctrl+D</b>
          (macOS: <b>Cmd+D</b>). \n\nThat way, if you don\u2019t like your changes,
          you\u2019ll have a saved copy of your original scene. \n\n<b>3.</b>  It
          can be overwhelming to think about level design when you already have a
          bunch of stuff in your scene \u2014 try moving all the furniture off to
          the side and starting fresh. \n\n<b>4.</b>  Rearrange the collectibles
          and furniture in your room in a way that makes it more fun and challenging
          to play. \n\nYou might need to make some furniture objects immovable by
          removing their <b>RIgidbody 2D</b> component in order to make the level
          more challenging. \n\n<b>5.</b>  Just like a real level designer, have
          a friend or family member test out your level and see what they think,
          then iterate on your design."
