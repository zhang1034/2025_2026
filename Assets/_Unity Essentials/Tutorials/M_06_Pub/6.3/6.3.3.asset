          a distinct element of creating with Unity: \n\n<b>1.</b>  The kid\u2019s
          room that showcases 3D physics. \n<b>2.</b>  The kitchen that showcases
          audio.\n<b>3.</b>  The living room that showcases programming and interactivity.\n\nWhy
          not combine all of those rooms together so that the player can explore
          the whole house? \n\nIn order to transfer the elements from each scene
          into another scene, you\u2019ll have to strategically create prefabs of
          each room and make sure to include only the objects you need. "

        m_Untranslated: "<b>1.</b>  Open the kid\u2019s room scene with the bouncing
          ball and the building blocks. \n\n<b>2.</b>  In the <b>Hierarchy</b> window,
          use <b>Ctrl</b> (macOS: <b>Cmd</b>) to select all the GameObjects you want
          to bring into your bonus scene \u2014 that should be all GameObjects except
          for the <b>Environment, Directional Light,</b> and <b>Camera.</b> \n\n<b>3.</b> 
          Right-click the selected GameObjects and select <b>Create Empty Parent</b>
          to group them under a single GameObject, then rename the new parent GameObject
          something like \u201CRoom_1\u201D.\n\n<b>4.</b>  Drag <b>Room_1</b> into
          your <b>My Prefabs</b> folder for re-use in the bonus scene later. \n\n<b>5.</b> 
          Repeat all the steps above for the other two rooms to create two more prefabs,
          <b>Room_2</b> and <b>Room_3</b>. \n\n<b>6.</b>  Open the <b>6_Bonus_Custom_Scene</b>,
          then drag all three prefabs into the scene, aligning them perfectly so
          that each doorway leads perfectly into the next room. \n\n<b>Important:</b> 
          Remember that you can only have one <b>Camera</b> GameObject in the scene,
          and there is already one attached to the player from the living room. If
          you have extra cameras, you\u2019ll need to delete them. \n\n<b>7.</b> 
          Customize your newly combined rooms to your liking. Here are a few ideas
          for you to consider:\n\n\u2022 Rotate the doors so that the player can
          easily move between the rooms or add the required components so that the
          doors open when the player approaches.\n\u2022 Add collectibles throughout
          the house.\n\u2022 Move the player into the kid\u2019s room so that they
          can see the bouncing ball hit the blocks. \n\u2022 Use some custom scripts
          to give the ball a bouncing sound and the falling blocks an impact sound.
          \n\u2022 Add the UI from the 2D project that tracks the number of remaining
          collectibles. \n\u2022 Add a VFX when the user obtains all the collectibles.\n\u2022
          Add your own ideas that would make this experience more interesting! "
