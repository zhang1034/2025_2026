        m_Untranslated: "You have completed all the work for this entire Pathway,
          where you have learned the essentials of creating in Unity.\n\nThink back
          to all you accomplished in this Pathway:\n\n\u2022 You explored the Editor
          interface.\n\u2022 You mastered 3D scene navigation and passed the <b>Scene</b>
          view flying test.\n\u2022 You created a mural in the <b>Scene</b> view.\n\u2022
          You added furniture to a kid\u2019s bedroom.\n\u2022 You made a bouncy
          ball with a custom material and physics.\n\u2022 You made a tower of prefab
          blocks.\n\u2022 You configured the skybox, lighting, and camera.\n\u2022
          You create an immersive soundscape in a kitchen.\n\u2022 You added a player
          movement script.\n\u2022 You coded a simple rotating object.\n\u2022 You
          coded a collectible that spawned a particle effect.\n\u2022 You set up
          a 2D room with specialized 2D components.\n\u2022 You completed a 2D puzzle
          game, including an animated 2D pet. \n\u2022 You set up your work as a
          single portfolio project.\n\u2022 You published to WebGL.\n\u2022 You recorded
          a video of your work. \n\nThat\u2019s quite an impressive list! Now all
          that's left to do is share your work with others on Unity Learn.\n\nWhen
          you do this, you will get XP on Unity Learn for completing the entire Unity
          Essentials Pathway, and you\u2019ll earn the official Unity Essentials
          badge."
