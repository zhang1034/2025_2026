        m_Untranslated: "The player is currently trapped in the living room. It would
          open up so many possibilities if the player was able to open the doors
          and enter other rooms. You could even connect the living room with the
          kitchen and the kid\u2019s room and allow the player to explore all three
          environments! \n\nTo allow the player to open the door, you\u2019ll need
          to add a new script that makes use of Unity\u2019s Animator system. You
          may not have realized this, but you can actually create animations directly
          in Unity and then trigger those animations via scripts. \n\nThe <b>Door</b>
          GameObject already has an <b>Animator</b> component with a Door_Open animation
          attached to it. You need to add the script that tells that animation to
          start when the player enters a trigger zone of the door. \n\nThis optional
          challenge is classified as Medium difficulty."

          > <b>Scripts</b> folder named \u201CDoorOpener\u201D. \n\n<b>Important:</b> 
          The name of this script must match exactly the name declared at the top
          of the class in the code snippet below (DoorOpener). \n\n<b>2.</b>  In
          the <b>Scene</b> view, select the door on the right side of the living
          room, then in the <b>Hierarchy</b> window, make sure you have selected
          the parent <b>Door</b> GameObject \u2014 and not the child <b>DoorPanel</b>
          or <b>DoorHandle</b> GameObjects. \n\nThe parent GameObject is the one
          with the <b>Animator</b> component attached to it. \n\n<b>3.</b>  With
          the <b>Door</b> GameObject selected, select <b>Add Component,</b> then
          search for and add your new <b>DoorOpener</b> script. \n\n<b>4.</b>  Open
          the <b>DoorOpener</b> script in your script editor, delete all the default
          code inside it, and replace it by copying and pasting the code below into
          the empty script. \n\nFeel free to read through the code to see if you
          can understand it, with help from the comments. When you\u2019re done,
          save your script and return to the Unity Editor. \n\nThe script relies
          on the door having a trigger zone that detects when the player has entered
          it. \n\n<b>5.</b>  With the <b>Door</b> GameObject still selected, add
          a new <b>Box Collider</b> component, then enable the <b>Is Trigger</b>
          property.  \n\n<b>6.</b>  In the <b>Box Collider</b> component, select
          <b>Edit Collider</b> then use the <b>Scene</b> view collider controls to
          set the size and position of the trigger zone. \n\n<b>7.</b>  Enter <b>Play</b>
          mode to test your game. \n\nWhen the player enters the trigger zone, the
          door should open!"
