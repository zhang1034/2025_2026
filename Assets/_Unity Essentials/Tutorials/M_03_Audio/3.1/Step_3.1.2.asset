        m_Untranslated: "In this step, you'll just explore the silent kitchen scene.
          \n\nThis scene is already set up with a script, attached to the Main Camera,
          that will work in Play mode. This script allows the user (you, for now)
          to easily explore the environment with the WASD keys and listen to the
          sounds in the scene from a first-person perspective. \n\nBy default, the
          Main Camera will have an <b>Audio Listener</b> component on it, which acts
          like the player\u2019s ears. When the <b>Audio Listener</b> component is
          far away from a sound, it should be quieter. When the <b>Audio Listener</b> 
          component is closer to a sound, it should be louder. With this component,
          the camera acts both as the player\u2019s eyes and ears in the scene. \n\nIn
          fact, Unity does not even allow you to have more than one active <b>Audio
          Listener</b> component in a scene. With multiple sets of \u201Cears\u201D
          in different locations, at what volume would you play a sound?"

          \n\n<b>2.</b>  In the <b>Scene</b> view, use Flythrough mode (right-click
          + WASD) or the Frame, Orbit, Zoom technique to give yourself a good view
          of the interior of the kitchen. \n\n<b>3.</b>  Enter <b>Play</b> mode to
          preview the silent kitchen scene, then use the WASD keys to move forward,
          backward, and to turn left and right. To look up and down, use your mouse.\n\nIf
          you are you using your mouse to look up and down and the cursor moves off
