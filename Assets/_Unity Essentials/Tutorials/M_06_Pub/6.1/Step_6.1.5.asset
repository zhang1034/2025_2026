        m_Untranslated: "In Unity, a <b>build</b> refers to the process of packaging
          your application into a standalone file that can run on a specific platform
          or device. One of the key steps in making a build is listing all of the
          scenes that should be included in your final application. \n\nIn your new
          <b>Main Menu</b> scene, when you select a <b>scene select</b> button, it
          tries to load one of the scenes listed for your build. The first button
          will try to load Scene 1 in your build, the second button will try to load
          Scene 2 in your build, and so on. The problem is, you haven\u2019t listed
          the scenes you want in your build yet, which is why those buttons don\u2019t
          work. In fact, you might have noticed that there was an error in the <b>Console</b>
          when you selected those buttons that said, \u201CScene with build index:
          [number] couldn't be loaded because it has not been added to the active
          build profile or shared scene list.\u201D\n\nIn this step, you\u2019ll
          select the scenes to include in your final build, which will allow your
          buttons to work properly. "

          Essentials</b> > <b>Scenes.</b>\n\n<b>2.</b>  Use the <b>Shift</b> key
          to select all the scenes you worked on, excluding the <b>Starter</b> scene,
          starting from <b>0_MainMenu_Scene</b> all the way to <b>5_TopDown_2D_Scene</b>.\n\n<b>Note:</b>  
          If you made a duplicate of any of your scenes, just select the one you
          want to include in your build. \n\n<b>3.</b>  Navigate to <b>File</b> >
          <b>Build Profiles</b> to open the <b>Build Profiles</b> window. You can
          also press <b>Ctrl+Shift+B</b> (macOS: <b>Cmd+Shift+B</b>).\n\n<b>4.</b> 
          In the <b>Build Profiles</b> window, select <b>Scene List</b> from the
          left <b>Platforms</b> panel. If there are any scenes already present in
          the <b>Scene List</b> section, select them and press the <b>Delete</b>
          key to remove them from the list.\n\n<b>5.</b>  Drag the selected scenes
          from the <b>Project</b> window directly into the <b>Scene List</b> section
          in the <b>Build Profiles</b> window. The build indexes on the right should
          range from <b>0</b> to <b>5.</b> \n\n<b>6.</b>  Enter <b>Play</b> mode
          again to test the scene select navigation. \n\nThis time, the buttons should
          correctly load the scenes you've set up in your build. \n\nAfter loading
          a scene, just press <b>Esc</b> to return to the <b>Main Menu</b> scene
          and select a new scene."
