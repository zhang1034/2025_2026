        m_Untranslated: "<b>Orbiting</b> is an essential navigation technique that
          lets you rotate your view around a selected object, providing a 360-degree
          perspective. \n\nOrbiting is different from using the View tool to look
          around in the scene, which you did before by right-clicking and dragging:\n\n\u2022
          Using the View tool and looking around is like moving your own head \u2014
          your position stays in place but the rotation changes.\n\u2022 Orbiting
          is like moving around an object while you stare at it \u2014 your focal
          point stays the same, but your position changes.\n\nIn this step, you'll
          orbit around the play structure and inspect it from underneath to uncover
          the third hidden number."

          then rotate your view (right-click and drag) to face the play structure
          with a slide.\n\n<b>2.</b>  With the <b>Move</b> tool still selected, click
          directly on the play structure in the <b>Scene</b> view to select it, then
          press <b>F</b> to frame it in view. \n\n<b>3.</b> Once the play structure
          is framed, hold <b>Alt</b> (macOS: <b>Option</b>), then <b>left-click</b>
          and drag with your mouse to orbit around the play structure. \n\nYou will
          find the third hidden number on the bottom of the play structure.\n\n<b>4.</b>
          After you've noted the number, orbit back up around to get a front-facing
          view of the play structure again.\n\nSoon, you'll get so much practice
          framing and orbiting, it will eventually be muscle memory. You also have
          that shortcut cheat sheet to help you remember all the ways you can navigate!"
