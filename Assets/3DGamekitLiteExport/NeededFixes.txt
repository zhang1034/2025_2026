Input Manager:
- Mouse Y duplicate -> CameraY, sensitivity 0,5
- Mouse X duplicate -> CameraX, sensitivity 2

Ellen and staff:
- Ellen needs to be in Player layer (staff maybe in Default?)
- Change the Damageable3D to Damageable script (same values)
- Staff: Target Layers -> Needed layers (enemies)

Chomper:
- Chomper needs to be in Enemies layer
- Fix materials
- Change the Damageable3D to Damageable script (same values)
- Nav Mesh Agent -> Humanoid (or create chomper)
- NavMesh Surface to Ground -> Bake for each agent type

Script problems:
- Add missing scripts from the FixScripts.unitypackage
- using Cinemachine; -> using Unity.Cinemachine;
- Handle Assembly Definition problems: Move scripts into same folder structure OR create and connect Assembly Definition Assets
- If needed: Problems with DamageMessage -> Duplicate Damageable.DamageMessage and change the partial class name to the missing one

------------------------

BreakableBox:
- Add correct Destructable script functionalities
- Damageable3D does not work due to Ellen's staff checking for Damageable component -> Change to Damageable (same values)
- If needed: Rename FPS Damageable to DamageableObject, so it does not conflict with other same name script
- If you have 3D Game Kit Lite in use: add the overridden Damageable.DamageMessage.cs (in Scripts/Game/DamageSystem if 3DGamekitLite)
